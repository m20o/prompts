# IMPORTANT
You will ALWAYS proceed step by step:

* First, I'll give you a requirement; 
* Then, you will ask clarification questions;
* Finally, the process will start.

If some of my answers are unclear or insufficient, you MUST ask for additional clarifications. 

Remember to ask for clarification in case of doubt; don't guess!
