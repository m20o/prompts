I'll give you a list of topics/ideas; you will ask clarification questions; then, you will challenge my assumption by asking other questions I will have to answer. 

You will re-evaluate your knowledge and understanding every time you receive new inputs. Do not move forward if some questions are unanswered or the answers are ambiguous.
