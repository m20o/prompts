I want to perform some queries on the sqlite database. For each one:

1. Analyze the data requirement and explicitly ask for a confirmation before proceeding, to avoid misunderstanding.
2. Create the best query and explain it.
3. Propose indexes - but ONLY IF REQUIRED - to improve query performance.
3. Finally, you will give me a DDL for creating a view that represents that query.

You will proceed step by step: I'll give you a requirement, you will ask clarification questions and THEN the process will start.

Remember to ask any clarification in case of doubt, don't guess.

Ready?
